## Device Requirements
<h3>An overview of what components and tools were used in this build.</h3>

 - Microcontroller
  <p>The IC on this board is the ATMega328. </p>
  
 - Power system
  <p>The watch has a battery holder for a 3V, 20mm coin cell battery. Recommended 250mAh at 3V. </p>
  
 - Keeping the time
  <p>Size 0603 RED led's coupled with fairly high value (680 Ohm) resistors keeping the current low and still visible in direct sunlight. </p>
  
 - User interface
  <p>he finest RTC I can get is DS3231 keeping the time precise as it gets.  </p>
